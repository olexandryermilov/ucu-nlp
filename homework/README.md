# Homework Tasks

*TASK 1. (10 points)* Add more operators to the rule parser: ? (optional), ! (negative), and * (zero or more). Keep in mind that the negative operator still returns a token that doesn't match any of the features wit that operator.

*TASK 2. (5 points)* Expand the ELIZA bot. You'll find the description for this task in the folder ELIZA.

*TASK 3. (5 points)* Create your own implementation of the Porter stemmer. It is not complicated, but it does have a very particular structure, so be sure to follow it! You can find a really nice guide here: http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/porter/stemmer.html
Input: a word (string)
Output: the stem of the word (string)
